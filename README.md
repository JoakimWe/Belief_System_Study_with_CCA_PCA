This is a study of Political Belief Systems using the methods of Correlational Class Analysis(CCA), Principal Component Analysis(PCA) and Multinomial Logistic Regression and is using data from European Social Survey in Sweden from the year 2018. 

In short a belief system can be described as a set of values and beliefs that create a coherent view of the world. In a population there can exist many different belief systems. And people can inhabit different sides in the same belief system, meaning they agree of what issues are important but disagree on the issues themselves. This can be examplified by two ideologues on oppposing sides on the political spectrum that are in disagreement on every issue at hand but actually agree with each other on which issues matter.

This study looks at the belief systems at play in the Swedish population with regards to issues surrounding authoritarianism, populism, views on immigration and views on homosexuality. The belief systems created by the CCA is further studied with the use of PCA to help understand the internal dynamics and structure of the individual beleif systems. These are later paired with voting behavior for different political parties with the use of multinomial logistic regression models to help distinguish how voters of the different political parties structure their view of the world concerning these issues.
